Conic Gradient:

It creates a gradient that radiates around a circle.
The stops are defined as percentages to determine where each color starts and ends.


Linear-gradient:

The `linear-gradient` function in CSS is used to create a smooth transition between two or more colors along a straight line. It's commonly used for backgrounds and decorative effects.

### Syntax
```css
background: linear-gradient(direction, color1, color2, ...);
```

---

### Key Components

1. **Direction**:
   - Defines the angle or side along which the gradient is applied.
   - Can be specified in three ways:
     - **Keywords**:
       - `to top`, `to bottom`, `to left`, `to right`, etc.
     - **Angles**:
       - E.g., `45deg`, `135deg` (0deg starts at the top and increases clockwise).
     - **Default**:
       - If no direction is specified, it defaults to `to bottom`.

2. **Color Stops**:
   - Specifies the colors used in the gradient and their positions.
   - Format: `color position`.
   - Example: `red 0%, blue 50%, green 100%`.

3. **Transparency**:
   - You can use colors with transparency (e.g., `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)` or `transparent`).

### Examples

1. **Simple Gradient**:
   ```css
   background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
   ```

2. **Multiple Colors**:
   ```css
   background: linear-gradient(to bottom, red, yellow, green);
   ```

3. **Angle-Based Gradient**:
   ```css
   background: linear-gradient(45deg, red, yellow);
   ```

4. **Gradient with Color Stops**:
   ```css
   background: linear-gradient(to bottom, red 20%, yellow 50%, green 100%);
   ```

5. **Gradient with Transparency**:
   ```css
   background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5), transparent);
   ```

### Properties of `linear-gradient`

- **Does Not Repeat**: Gradients fill the container once by default.
- **Used as a Background**: Often applied to the `background` property of an element.
- **Works with Shapes**: Can be combined with shapes like borders or masks.

### Practical Uses

- **Stylish Buttons**:
  ```css
  button {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff7e5f, #feb47b);
    color: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }
  ```

- **Background for Sections**:
  ```css
  section {
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #6a11cb, #2575fc);
    color: white;
    padding: 50px;
  }
  ```

- **Overlays**:
  ```css
  .overlay {
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8));
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
  ```

### Browser Support
- Fully supported in modern browsers.
- No prefix is needed for most modern browsers.
- For older versions, you may need vendor prefixes:
  - `-webkit-` (e.g., `-webkit-linear-gradient` for older Safari).
